Pteropod Shells

Carbon dioxide (CO₂) dissolves in seawater to form carbonic acid.

The process is known as ocean acidification.

In a field study, scientists investigated the effect of ocean acidification on the shells of pteropods (planktonic snails).

The shells contain calcium carbonate.

They collected pteropods and several water samples from each site.

They then examined the shells for small holes called pits.

Water is 'saturated' if the maximum amount of a solute is dissolved in it.

Water is 'undersaturated' if it contains less than the maximum amount of dissolved solute.
