<p>Once upon a time there was a translator who worked in OmegaT. The translator had to pay attention to formatting such as <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italics</em>, <span class="underline">underline</span>. The translator had to pay attention to “quotation marks”. He also used non-breaking spaces, when needed.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency, the translator used the fuzzy matches and performed concordance searches. The translator also added recurring terms to the glossary, such as “the translator”. Before delivery, the translator performed a few quality assurance checks: for example on completion and tag errors. After delivery, the translator took a well-deserved rest!</p>
